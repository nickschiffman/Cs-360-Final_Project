# Cs-360-Final_Project
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The User needed to be able to loging and create or edit a list of inventory items. They also were allowed the optionto resceive notifications for when an item fell low on stock.
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app needed to consist of three major screens one for logining in and signing up, the secend for reading and editing the information tied to each object and finally a settings page to allow the user to sign up for notifications based on low inventory
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
My main method was planning and setting out steps in in comments that then turned into documentation, this allowed for me to create smaller projects and fill in the gaps as I went.
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
After every step I would send it over to the simulator to first test if the program would crash and most time it did but also to test the functionality I just implemented.
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
When design the app I needed to add inovationto how the data would be stored and also grabbed, so I created my own inventory modle that would contain all my main functionality for then I was displaing to the user or just reading and writing to the data base.
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The component that was most sucessful from my mobile app would have been creating my own model that I could use to read and write to my personalized SQLHelper, this was a challenging yet fun experience.
